# password-generator
A password generator using the random module in Python.

## Password Generator How-To:
1. Copy code into any IDE supporting Python.
2. The random module should automatically be imported through the 'import random' statement.
3. Run code, this will than give you options (through input statements), these options will help create your password.
- When answering the input questions, password length must be answered as an integer (1, 10, 15, etc.).
- When the question contains (y/n) answer using y or n. y = Yes, n = No.

This is obviously a very simple project but if you feel like a change should be made, pull requests are welcome.

## Built With:
- Made using Python and the built-in random module.
- Created using the PyCharm IDE by JetBrains.
- Inspired from: https://bit.ly/3iGM6zF (An Instructables Article on how to make a Random Password Generator With Python).
- I first created a password generator with help from the 'Instructables' article above, than made my own version with some very MAJOR changes.
